# Lead handoff (Supervisor)

Trigger: the Lead's context is past the project law's limit (default ~45% of its window), it
loses the thread after compaction, it stalls twice, or the Owner asks.

1. Mail the current Lead (`needs: reply`): finish the step in flight, start no new dispatch, and
   produce a **handoff**: accepted candidates, open loops with owners and return checkpoints,
   owned scopes and their Peers (ids), the current plan and what changed and why, decisions and
   dissent recorded, lessons learned ("which mistakes would you avoid next time"), and usable
   downstream inputs.
2. Create the successor: `create_agent` with the Lead provider and settings from your role,
   `notifyOnFinish: false`, `initialPrompt` = the workstream's intent record + the handoff +
   "adopt these Peers: re-prompt each with its brief and your disposition of its last signal, or
   archive and relaunch its scope".
3. Verify adoption: the successor's first report lists every adopted Peer with a disposition.
   Until then, results from those Peers reach no one.
4. Archive the old Lead only after the successor's first report is in. Record both ids and the
   handoff location in `.slp/status.md`.
5. Lessons: copy the old Lead's lessons into `.slp/notebook.md`. Do not patch the law or role
   files on the spot; adjusting immediately makes the next run unpredictable. Let a few sessions
   accumulate, then propose corrections.
