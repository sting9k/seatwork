name: slp-write-brief
description: "Lead procedure to write a Peer or Lens brief that locks the contract and leaves the implementation to its owner: the template, the contract checklist, the read-only suffix, the create_agent call. Use before every launch. The template and a filled example are in references/brief-template.md."

# Write the brief (Lead)
1. Fill the template in [references/brief-template.md](references/brief-template.md): Project,
   Outcome, Candidate, Context (paths and `RECAP` lines, never contents), Write scope,
   Contract / invariants, Yours to decide, Constraints, Output, Acceptance evidence, Reopen
   when, What was tried (on any retry), and the last line `Reply with slp_mail to: owner`. The
   file ends with a filled example and what it deliberately leaves out.
2. Lock only what other components depend on: what the API promises, valid inputs, what success
   means, state and data ownership, how errors show, the test that proves it. Enough when two
   Peers reading it would build parts that fit: where words could be read two ways, give one
   example input → output or the test's name. Too much when it names anything inside one scope:
   a line that says create, call, or use a variable inside the Peer's scope goes; a plan that
   names symbols before anyone opened the code is implementing in markdown. If you cannot write
   acceptance evidence, split or research first.
3. `Outcome` is the real need, never a technology; `Candidate` is the solution currently tried,
   marked changeable, so the Peer may come back with evidence: "ensure the browser gets call
   state with these latency/order/reconnect semantics" is the outcome, "WebSocket" the candidate.
4. Writable briefs forbid stopping to offer a menu of implementation options: the owner decides
   inside its scope; a genuinely cross-boundary decision may be asked as one short, concrete
   yes/no question, never as an option-selection ritual.
5. Read-only briefs say `read-only — do not modify files` in Write scope, use `[Peer:review]` or
   `[Peer:research]` (a lens is its own seat: `[Lens]`, see `slp-lens`), and end with the
   read-only suffix from the template file, verbatim.
6. `create_agent` with `title`, `provider` from your role's table, `settings`, `initialPrompt`,
   `notifyOnFinish: false`; no `cwd`, no `background`. Then continue unrelated ready work or end
   your turn; the Peer's mail wakes you.
